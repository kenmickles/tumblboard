tumblboard
=============
Posts [Pinboard](http://pinboard.in) links to [Tumblr](http://tumblr.com), via cron. Tumblr's RSS importer should be able to do this in theory, but I've never found it to work reliably.

To setup:
-------------------
Add your Pinboard and Tumblr credentials to config.ini and create a cron job to run the script.
